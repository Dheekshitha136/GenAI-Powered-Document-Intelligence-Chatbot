This project is a Generative AI–based document intelligence chatbot designed to answer both document-centric and general user queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
The system performs semantic understanding and contextual reasoning to provide accurate and relevant responses across diverse documents.
The chatbot supports multimodal interaction, allowing users to interact via text and optional voice input/output, and includes multilingual capabilities to enhance accessibility.
By combining LLM-driven reasoning with efficient information retrieval, the project demonstrates the practical design and deployment of real-world AI systems for intelligent document analysis and conversational assistance.
